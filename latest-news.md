## Latest Developments

To bring you up to speed on where things are currently at, below is a
timeline of key events (in chronological order) since last my last update. My
last update was in September.

1. Fall 2017: If you recall from my last update, last fall the San Francisco
   Department of Elections issued an RFP for someone to write a report
   that analyzes the feasibility of the City and County of San Francisco
   developing and certifying an open source voting system. This was at the
   request of the Mayor's Office during Mayor Ed Lee's tenure.

   The consulting firm [Slalom](https://www.slalom.com/) won the contract out
   of three bidders. The contract was for $175K to write the report. This was
   taken out of the $300K that Mayor Lee allocated in 2016 for the planning
   phase of the open source voting project. Slalom's report was originally
   supposed to be finished at the end of January 2018, but it wasn't finished
   until a couple months later (more on this below).

1. January 2018: San Francisco's budget process started around January like
   it does every year. It will continue until around August 1. Mayor Farrell
   will propose a budget to the Board of Supervisors around June 1, which is
   one month from now. After that, the Board will have a chance to make
   changes to the Mayor's proposed budget.

   It's important for the Mayor's initial proposed budget to include adequate
   funding for the project. It is much harder for the Board to change the
   budget after the fact because there are less funds to work with.

   In parallel and on a similar schedule, the California State government is
   also going through its own budget process.

1. February 2018: In February, a good government group called the
   [California Clean Money Campaign](http://www.caclean.org/) stepped up in a
   big way to help build support for and secure funding for San Francisco's
   open source voting project -- both at the city level and at the state
   level. California Clean Money is a statewide non-profit with over 100,000
   members or supporters. Last fall they capped a successful 7-year campaign
   to pass the landmark California DISCLOSE Act. They have a lot of
   grassroots organizing clout, so their help has been tremendous! They are
   the ones organizing the kickoff event on May 6 in San Francisco.

1. March 8, 2018: At its March 8 meeting, the Elections Commission's
   5-member [Open Source Voting System Technical Advisory
   Committee](https://osvtac.github.io/) (OSVTAC) approved a brief letter to
   send to the Elections Commission. The letter spells out some brief
   recommendations on how initial development funds should be spent.

   Briefly, it recommends that the City hire a full-time lead for the project
   as a first step to coordinate and decide next steps. Currently, there is
   no staff person in City government with the time and expertise to lead the
   project. TAC's recommendation also says that the vote-by-mail components
   of the system should be developed first. It outlines a number of reasons
   for this, including because it would be easier and cheaper to do, and
   because 63% of voters voted by mail in the last election. So this would
   be a way to get a bigger bang for the buck initially. You can read
   OSVTAC's full 2-page letter
   [here](http://sfgov.org/electionscommission/sites/default/files/Documents/meetings/2018/2018-03-21-commission/OSVTAC_Recommendation_re_Funding_March_19_2018.pdf).

1. March 21, 2018 (#1): Slalom's feasibility report was originally supposed to
   be finished at the end of January. Instead, it was completed in mid-March
   and published in the agenda packet of the San Francisco Elections
   Commission's March 21 meeting, which you can find
   [here](http://sfgov.org/electionscommission/commission-agenda-packet-march-21-2018).
   The Elections Commission briefly discussed the report at that meeting.

1. March 21, 2018 (#2): Also at the Elections Commission's March 21 meeting,
   the California Clean Money Campaign announced some exciting news during
   public comment. They announced that State Assemblymember David Chiu and
   State Senator Scott Wiener both agreed to submit a budget request in the
   State's budget process for $8 million in matching funds for the
   development of an open source voting system licensed with GPL version 3, a
   strong copyleft license.

   The funds would be made available to one county in California. California
   Clean Money is working with them on the request. However, to proceed with
   the request, they needed a letter of support from one or more of Mayor
   Farrell, Supervisor Malia Cohen (because she chairs the San Francisco
   Board's Budget Committee), and President of the Board London Breed.

   Assemblymember Chiu and Senator Wiener are two of San Francisco's three
   representatives in the State Legislature. Senator Wiener is also the one
   who authored the Board of Supervisor's December 2014 resolution that
   committed the City to moving forward on open source voting. The resolution
   passed unanimously at the time. Mayor Farrell, Supervisor Cohen,
   President Breed, and Supervisor Kim all voted in favor of the resolution
   at the time.

1. March 21, 2018 (#3): After discussing the Slalom Report and hearing
   the above news at the meeting, the Elections Commission then voted
   unanimously to do three things:

   * To adopt the recommendations of the Commission's Technical Advisory
     Committee and send them to the Mayor's Office, as well as the City's
     [Committee on Information Technology](https://sfcoit.org/) COIT.
     (COIT is a large 15-member body within San Francisco government
     that reviews and decides on funding allocations for any technology
     project over $100,000. The Mayor uses COIT's funding recommendations
     when crafting a budget to propose to the Board of Supervisors, but
     isn't limited to following COIT's recommendation.)

   * To request that the Mayor and Board of Supervisors budget at least
     $4 million for the first year of development.

   * To ask Mayor Farrell and Board Budget Chair Malia Cohen to send a
     letter to the State Capitol in support of the budget request that
     California Clean Money was working on with Assemblymember Chiu
     and Senator Wiener.

1. April 1, 2018: The San Francisco Examiner published an article on
   April 1 about the developments at the March 21 Commission meeting,
   including the possibility of $8 million in state matching funds, and
   whether Mayor Farrell and Supervisor Cohen were willing to send a letter:
   [“Open-source voting in SF may require match of state, local
   funds.“](http://www.sfexaminer.com/open-source-voting-sf-may-require-match-state-local-funds/)

1. April 4, 2018: A few days after the first SF Examiner article, Supervisor
   Cohen agreed to send a letter in support of the budget request. However,
   Mayor Farrell still hasn't agreed to sending a support letter, even though
   sending such a letter wouldn't commit San Francisco to allocating any
   funds towards the project. The Examiner published a second article on
   April 4 covering these newer developments, including Supervisor Cohen's
   support: [“State funding proposal for open source voting gains
   support.“](http://www.sfexaminer.com/open-source-voting-sf-may-require-match-state-local-funds/)

1. April 13, 2018: At its April 13 meeting, COIT's Budget & Performance
   Subcommittee voted unfortunately to recommend allocating only $300K for
   the first year of the open source voting project. It's not clear what
   that money would or could be used for, though, since it falls below the
   estimates for any of the next steps outlined in Slalom's Report. You can
   see their matrix of recommended funding amounts (including the open
   source voting project) in the document on
   [this page](https://sfcoit.org/node/100000883) called, ["FY 2018-19 &
   FY 2019-20 Subcommittee Budget
   Recommendations.pdf."](https://sfcoit.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/FY%202018-19%20%26%20FY%202019-20%20Subcommittee%20Budget%20Recommendations.pdf)

1. At its [May 4 meeting](https://sfcoit.org/calendar), COIT will be voting
   on whether to approve its Budget & Performance Subcommittee's recommendation
   to allocate only $300K to the project for the next fiscal year (from
   August 2018 to July 2019).  Mayor Farrell will use COIT's recommendation
   in deciding how much money to allocate for the project in his proposed
   budget due to the Board by June 1.
