# Open Source Voting Supporters

There is strong support in San Francisco to create an open source voting
system:

* [San Francisco Board of Supervisors](#sf-board-of-supervisors)
* [San Francisco Elections Commission](#sf-elections-commission)

In addition, below are some of those in support of the City and County of San
Francisco starting and fully funding a project to develop and certify an open
source paper-ballot voting system:

* [Organizations](#organizations)
* [San Francisco Residents](#san-francisco-residents)
* [Other Individuals](#other-individuals)

For information on being listed on this page, contact <info@sfopenvoting.org>.
Many of these supporters have also sent letters to the Mayor and Board of
Supervisors.

[Coming soon: sample letter of support.]
